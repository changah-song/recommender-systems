### Series on Recommender Systems

This repository is where the code for the [Medium series of recommender systems](https://medium.com/@paul0/recommender-systems-for-dummies-84d4d0b5b58e) created by Paul Song resides.  
The dataset and ipynb file used can be found here.  
Please follow along if you want and enjoy the Medium article series :)
  
[Here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#foodcom) is a website with various datasets you can play around with if you want to try out something other than Movie ratings.  
  
Hope this can be a helpful starting place for anyone getting into recommender systems!
